# Tutorial
We provide a [tutorial website](https://mxcai.github.io/XMAP-tutorial/index.html) of XMAP for analyzing cross-population GWAS data. Please see the vignettes in the tutorial for details of installation, usage and visualization. The datasets involved in the tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mcaiad_connect_ust_hk/EhJHXBkK_DNBjLFbIPjMeaoBFlmFwlz0F_uXXU0kvIrVGg?e=sTEh8O).

# Reproducibility
We provide codes and fine-mapping results presented in the XMAP manuscript [here](https://github.com/YangLabHKUST/XMAP/tree/main/results)
